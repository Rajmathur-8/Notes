# TCP/IP Model
The **TCP/IP model** is how computers talk over the Internet. It has **4 layers**:

1. **Application** — apps & protocols you use (HTTP, DNS, SMTP...)
2. **Transport** — delivery between programs on hosts (TCP, UDP)
3. **Internet** — addressing & routing across networks (IP, ICMP)
4. **Link (Network Interface)** — local network hardware (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC)

Think of sending a file like mailing a package:

* Application = writing the message and choosing service (e.g., express or regular)
* Transport = putting message into parcels and labeling with recipient’s apartment number
* Internet = writing the city/state (IP addressing) and deciding route
* Link = postal truck / local courier that physically moves the parcel door-to-door

---

# Layer-by-layer — easy words + what each layer does

## 1) Application layer — "the stuff you see"

* **What it is:** the programs and protocols you interact with: browsers (HTTP/HTTPS), email clients (SMTP/IMAP), file transfer (FTP), name lookups (DNS).
* **Responsibility:** prepares the actual data — webpages, emails, DNS queries — and uses protocols that define how that data should look and behave.
* **Analogy:** writing a letter (the content and language).
* **Examples:** HTTP (web), SMTP (send mail), DNS (translate names to IPs), SSH (secure remote login).

---

## 2) Transport layer — "deliver to the right apartment"

Two main protocols: **TCP** (reliable) and **UDP** (fast & simple).

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

* **What it gives you:** reliable, ordered, error-checked delivery.
* **How:** sets up a connection (three-way handshake), splits data into segments, numbers them, waits for ACKs, resends lost segments, and controls flow so the receiver isn’t overwhelmed.
* **Key features:** ports (like apartment numbers), sequence numbers, ACKs, retransmissions, flow control (window), congestion control (slow start, congestion avoidance).
* **When used:** web pages (HTTPS), email, file transfer.

### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

* **What it gives you:** minimal delivery — sends packets (datagrams) without setup or guaranteed delivery.
* **Key features:** tiny header, no handshake, no retransmit/ordering.
* **When used:** DNS queries, live video/voice (where speed > perfect reliability), online games.

**Analogy:** TCP = courier that confirms delivery and will resend if lost. UDP = postcard — quick, but no guarantees.

---

## 3) Internet layer — "addressing and routing across cities"

* **Main protocol:** IP (Internet Protocol). Versions: IPv4 (common) and IPv6 (newer).
* **Responsibilities:** attach source/destination IP addresses, route packets across many networks, fragmentation if packet too big, handle Time To Live (TTL) so packets don’t circle forever.
* **Other protocols:** ICMP (ping, error messages), IGMP (multicast), for IPv4 ARP is used at link-level to map IP→MAC.
* **Analogy:** writing city/state on the parcel and the post office deciding which route/trucks to use.

---

## 4) Link (Network Interface) layer — "local delivery & physical bits"

* **What it is:** how devices actually put bits on a medium (Ethernet on copper/fiber, Wi-Fi radio).
* **Responsibilities:** frame construction (MAC addresses), error checking at frame level, physical transmission of bits.
* **Components:** NIC (Network Interface Card), switches, hubs, cables, wireless radios.
* **Analogy:** the postal truck and local courier who get the parcel from the post office to the exact house.

# Encapsulation — how data is wrapped as it travels

When you send data, it’s wrapped in headers layer-by-layer:

```
Application data
→ Transport header + application data  (TCP/UDP segment)
→ Internet header + transport segment  (IP packet)
→ Link header + IP packet + link trailer (Ethernet frame)
→ physical bits on wire/wireless
```

Each layer adds info (headers) needed by the corresponding receiver at the other end.

---

# Concrete example: You open `https://example.com` in a browser

1. **DNS lookup** (Application): Browser asks DNS for `example.com` → gets an IP (e.g., `93.184.216.34`).
2. **TCP handshake** (Transport): Browser and server do **SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK** to open a TCP connection (port 443 for HTTPS).
3. **HTTPS/TLS setup** (Application over Transport): TLS handshake secures the connection (keys exchanged).
4. **HTTP GET** (Application): Browser sends `GET /` inside the TLS session → then inside TCP.
5. **Packets flow**: Browser’s data goes through TCP (segments), IP (packets), Ethernet/Wi-Fi (frames). Routers forward based on IP, switches forward based on MAC.
6. **Server replies**: HTML arrives, TCP reassembles segments in order, the browser renders the page.
7. **Connection close**: TCP FIN/ACK exchange tears down the connection.

At each router hop, the **IP** header is consulted for routing; at the local network, **Ethernet** frames use MAC addresses.

---

# Important technical details (but simple)

### Ports & sockets

* **Port:** a number identifying a program on a machine (HTTP: 80, HTTPS: 443, DNS: 53).
* **Socket:** combination of IP + port (e.g., `93.184.216.34:443`).

### TCP reliability basics

* **Sequence numbers:** order segments.
* **ACKs:** receiver acknowledges received bytes.
* **Retransmit:** if sender doesn’t get ACK in time, it resends.
* **Flow control (window):** receiver tells sender how much it can accept.
* **Congestion control:** sender adjusts speed based on network signals (loss, delay).

### IP addressing & subnetting

* **IPv4:** dotted decimal (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) with subnet mask (`/24` = 255.255.255.0).
* **IPv6:** long hex addresses (huge address space).
* **Router:** device that forwards packets between networks based on IP.

### ARP & MAC addresses

* **MAC address:** unique hardware address (like a door number on the house).
* **ARP:** used in IPv4 local networks to map an IP to a MAC address.

### MTU & fragmentation

* **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit):** largest packet that can go on a link (Ethernet common MTU is 1500 bytes).
* If IP packet > MTU, routers may fragment it (IPv6 avoids fragmentation by routers; sender is encouraged to use Path MTU Discovery).

---

# Diagnostics & tools (quick)

* `ping` → tests reachability (ICMP echo).
* `traceroute`/`tracert` → shows path routers take (uses TTL/ICMP).
* `netstat` / `ss` → shows active sockets and ports.
* `tcpdump` / `wireshark` → capture and inspect packets.

---

# Simple glossary

* **Packet/Datagram:** unit at IP layer.
* **Segment:** unit at TCP layer.
* **Frame:** unit at link layer (Ethernet).
* **Router:** forwards IP packets between networks.
* **Switch:** forwards frames within the same local network (by MAC).

Nice — let’s deep-dive the **network layer** protocols in plain-language, step-by-step, with what they do, how they work, and the advantages & disadvantages of each. I’ll cover the major ones you’ll see in real networks: **IPv4 / IPv6, ICMP, ARP, IGMP/MLD, routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP)**, and **IPsec** (network-layer security). I’ll also point out a few extras and practical notes.

# Big picture first

The **network layer** (Internet-layer in TCP/IP) is mainly responsible for **addressing** and **routing** packets so they can travel from one host to another across potentially many networks. The core protocol is **IP** (Internet Protocol). Surrounding IP are supportive protocols that handle diagnostics, address resolution, multicast, routing decisions, and security.

----------

# 1) IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

### Function (simple)

Gives every host an IP address and defines how to form IP **packets** so routers can forward them across networks.

### How it works (step-by-step)

1.  Upper layer hands application data to transport (TCP/UDP); the transport creates a segment.
    
2.  IP wraps that segment into an **IP packet** by adding an IP header with source/destination addresses and control fields (TTL, protocol, checksum, fragmentation info).
    
3.  Routers look at the **destination IP** and forward the packet toward that address using routing tables.
    
4.  If a link has an MTU smaller than the packet, IPv4 routers can fragment the packet into smaller pieces; destination reassembles.
    

### Important IPv4 header fields (what they do)

-   **Version** — 4
    
-   **IHL** — header length
    
-   **Total Length** — packet size
    
-   **Identification / Flags / Fragment Offset** — used for fragmentation/reassembly
    
-   **TTL (Time To Live)** — limits lifetime (decrements at each hop)
    
-   **Protocol** — indicates payload type (TCP, UDP, ICMP...)
    
-   **Header Checksum** — verifies header integrity (only header)
    
-   **Source / Destination IP** — 32-bit addresses
    

### Advantages

-   Simple, widely supported, backward-compatible ecosystem.
    
-   Efficient header size for typical networks; works well for most internet traffic.
    

### Disadvantages

-   **Address exhaustion** — only ~4.3 billion addresses (necessitated IPv6).
    
-   Fragmentation adds overhead and complexity.
    
-   Header checksum only covers header, not payload.
    
-   NAT became common to extend address space — creates complexity for some applications.
    

----------

# 2) IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)

### Function

Replacement for IPv4 — large address space and design improvements for modern networks.

### How it works (high level)

-   Similar role as IPv4 but uses 128-bit addresses, simplified header, improved extension header mechanism, and removes in-router fragmentation (hosts perform Path MTU Discovery).
    
-   Supports features like mandatory IPsec support (original design), simplified autoconfiguration (SLAAC), and better multicast.
    

### Important IPv6 header fields (high level)

-   **Version** — 6
    
-   **Payload Length** — length of payload (no total length including header because header fixed-size)
    
-   **Next Header** — indicates payload or extension header type
    
-   **Hop Limit** — replaces TTL
    
-   **Source / Destination IP** — 128-bit addresses
    

### Advantages

-   Vast address space (practically unlimited for current needs).
    
-   Simplified header (faster processing in routers).
    
-   Built-in features for autoconfiguration and better multicast handling.
    
-   Better support for mobile and modern networks.
    

### Disadvantages

-   Transition complexity: IPv4 and IPv6 coexist; migrating networks is work.
    
-   Some middleboxes (firewalls, NATs) and legacy systems complicate deployment.
    
-   Not all networks/services fully support IPv6 (still improving).
    

----------

# 3) ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

### Function

“Messenger” for IP — reports errors and provides network diagnostics (like `ping` and `traceroute`).

### How it works

-   When a router or host needs to notify sender of an issue (destination unreachable, TTL expired, redirect), it sends an ICMP packet back to the source IP.
    
-   Tools:
    
    -   `ping` uses **ICMP Echo Request / Echo Reply** to test reachability and round-trip time.
        
    -   `traceroute` uses TTL-expired ICMP messages to map the path.
        

### Common message types

-   **Echo Request / Echo Reply** — ping.
    
-   **Destination Unreachable** — indicates packet couldn't be delivered (network/host/port unreachable).
    
-   **Time Exceeded** — TTL reached zero (used by traceroute).
    
-   **Redirect** — router tells host of a better next-hop (rare/used with caution).
    

### Advantages

-   Essential for diagnostics and network troubleshooting.
    
-   Lightweight and standardized.
    

### Disadvantages / Risks

-   Can be abused (ICMP flood DDoS, ping of death historically).
    
-   Some networks drop or rate-limit ICMP for security, which can hinder diagnostics.
    
-   ICMP Redirects can be used maliciously if not filtered.
    

----------

# 4) ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) — **IPv4 local networks**

### Function

Map an **IPv4 address** to a **MAC (physical) address** on a local network — essential for hosts to actually deliver frames on Ethernet/Wi-Fi.

### How it works (step-by-step)

1.  Host A wants to send an IP packet to Host B on the same LAN but only knows B's IP.
    
2.  Host A broadcasts an **ARP Request**: “Who has IP X.X.X.X? Tell me (MAC of A).”
    
3.  Host B responds with an **ARP Reply**: “I have that IP — my MAC is YY:YY:YY.”
    
4.  Host A stores mapping in its ARP cache (temporary) and uses MAC to send Ethernet frames.
    

### Additional notes

-   **Gratuitous ARP** — a host announces its own IP→MAC mapping (used for detection or update).
    
-   **Proxy ARP** — a router answers ARP on behalf of another host (used in some legacy scenarios).
    

### Advantages

-   Simple and fast for resolving local link addresses.
    
-   Works automatically without central server.
    

### Disadvantages / Risks

-   Broadcast-based — causes local broadcast traffic.
    
-   ARP cache poisoning (a security attack) — attackers can send fake ARP replies and intercept traffic (Mitigation: static ARP or dynamic security like DHCP snooping + ARP inspection).
    
-   ARP is IPv4-only; IPv6 uses Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).
    

----------

# 5) Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) — IPv6 equivalent of ARP

### Function

In IPv6, NDP handles address resolution, router discovery, duplicate address detection, and more (via ICMPv6 messages).

### How it works (high level)

-   Uses ICMPv6 message types: Router Solicitation, Router Advertisement, Neighbor Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement.
    
-   Eliminates ARP and consolidates several functions.
    

### Advantages

-   More feature-rich and secure options (SEND - Secure Neighbor Discovery exists).
    
-   Works with IPv6 autoconfiguration.
    

### Disadvantages

-   Complexity and IPv6 deployment issues.
    
-   NDP can also be targeted by attacks if not secured.
    

----------

# 6) IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) and MLD (IPv6)

### Function

Manage **multicast group membership** on IPv4 networks (IGMP) and IPv6 (MLD). Hosts tell local routers which multicast groups they want to receive.

### How it works

-   Host sends IGMP Join to indicate interest in a multicast group (e.g., streaming to `224.0.0.x` addresses).
    
-   Router keeps track of active groups per subnet and forwards multicast traffic only to subnets with interested hosts.
    

### Advantages

-   Efficient delivery for one-to-many streaming (saves bandwidth vs. many separate unicast streams).
    

### Disadvantages

-   Requires router and network support (multicast routing, PIM, etc.).
    
-   Can be tricky to configure across large networks and over the Internet (multicast across ISPs is limited).
    

----------

# 7) Routing Protocols — how routers learn where to send packets

Routing protocols operate at the network layer (they build and update routing tables). I’ll explain three common types with how they work and pros/cons.

## 7a) RIP (Routing Information Protocol) — Distance-vector

### Function

Simple routing using **hop count** as metric; routers periodically share routing tables with neighbors.

### How it works

-   Each router sends its routing table to neighbors every 30 seconds.
    
-   Routes are chosen by the smallest hop count (max 15 hops allowed; 16 = unreachable).
    

### Advantages

-   Easy to configure and understand. Good for small networks.
    

### Disadvantages

-   Slow convergence (slow to adapt to changes).
    
-   Count-to-infinity problems (routing loops).
    
-   Not suitable for large networks (hop limit of 15).
    

## 7b) OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) — Link-state

### Function

More advanced internal (IGP) routing protocol that builds a full map of the network and computes shortest paths using Dijkstra’s algorithm.

### How it works

-   Routers exchange **link-state advertisements (LSAs)** describing links and costs to neighbors.
    
-   Each router builds the same topology database and runs Dijkstra to compute shortest-path tree and routing table.
    
-   Converges quickly and supports areas for scalability.
    

### Advantages

-   Fast convergence.
    
-   Scales well (areas reduce complexity).
    
-   Metric based on link cost (flexible).
    
-   Loop-free routing.
    

### Disadvantages

-   More complex to configure and manage.
    
-   More CPU/memory overhead (maintaining topology DB).
    
-   Typically used within an organization (IGP), not across autonomous systems.
    

## 7c) BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) — Path-vector / inter-domain

### Function

The core protocol that routes traffic between **autonomous systems (ASes)** on the global Internet. Chooses routes based on policies and path attributes, not just shortest path.

### How it works

-   BGP peers exchange path information (AS path, next hop, attributes).
    
-   Route selection uses attributes (local preference, AS path length, MED, etc.) and administrative policies.
    

### Advantages

-   Policy-driven control for Internet routing.
    
-   Scales to the whole global Internet.
    
-   Avoids simple metric-based problems by using AS path and policy.
    

### Disadvantages

-   Complex configuration and policy management.
    
-   Slow convergence compared to IGPs for large changes.
    
-   Can propagate bad routes if misconfigured (route leaks, prefix hijacks).
    
-   Security concerns — requires validation (RPKI helps).
    

----------

# 8) IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)

### Function

Provides **confidentiality, integrity, and authentication** at the network layer. Can secure any IP traffic without altering applications.

### How it works (two main protocols)

-   **AH (Authentication Header)** — provides integrity and authentication (no encryption of payload).
    
-   **ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)** — provides encryption (confidentiality), plus optional integrity/authentication.
    

Modes:

-   **Transport mode** — protects the payload of the IP packet (end-to-end).
    
-   **Tunnel mode** — encapsulates the entire IP packet inside a new IP packet (used for VPNs between gateways).
    

Key exchange: typically done by **IKE (Internet Key Exchange)** to establish shared keys and SA (security associations).

### Advantages

-   Transparent to applications — secures any IP traffic.
    
-   Flexible (tunnel mode widely used for VPNs).
    
-   Strong security when properly configured.
    

### Disadvantages

-   Complexity in configuration (keys, policies, NAT traversal).
    
-   Performance overhead from encryption/decryption.
    
-   Middleboxes (NAT) complicate IPsec (NAT-Traversal helps).
    
-   Misconfiguration can lead to vulnerabilities.
    

----------

# 9) Other supporting / legacy protocols

### RARP (Reverse ARP)

-   **Function:** old protocol to map MAC→IP (obsolete; DHCP replaced it).
    
-   **Status:** rarely used today.
    

### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

-   **Layer:** Application layer but used to assign IP addresses for the network layer.
    
-   **Why mention:** DHCP gives IPs, default gateway, DNS info — critical for network-layer operation.
    

----------

# Practical behaviors & interactions (common operational topics)

### Fragmentation

-   IPv4 routers can fragment; IPv6 routers do **not** — sender must use Path MTU Discovery to avoid fragmentation.
    
-   Fragmentation causes overhead and possible performance problems; modern networks prefer PMTUD.
    

### TTL/Hop Limit

-   Prevents looped packets from circulating forever; helps tools like traceroute.
    

### NAT (Network Address Translation)

-   Not an IP protocol itself, but commonly used with IPv4. NAT rewrites source/destination IP/ports — allows multiple devices to share one public IP.
    
-   **Pros:** conserves addresses, provides basic security via address hiding.
    
-   **Cons:** breaks end-to-end connectivity, complicates protocols (SIP, FTP), and interferes with IPsec unless NAT-Traversal used.
    

### Security risks & mitigations

-   ARP spoofing → mitigated by dynamic ARP inspection, static ARP entries.
    
-   BGP hijacking → mitigated by RPKI/route filtering and careful policy.
    
-   ICMP misuse → rate-limit or filter but don’t block all ICMP (diagnostics break).
    
-   IPv6 considerations — new attack surface; secure NDP (SEND) and proper firewalling recommended.

# Examples / mini walkthroughs

### ARP example (short)

-   PC wants to send to 192.168.1.10. No MAC known → broadcast ARP request.
    
-   PC with 192.168.1.10 replies with its MAC. Sender caches and sends frame.
    

### ICMP ping

-   `ping 8.8.8.8` → host sends ICMP Echo Request to 8.8.8.8. If reachable, that host replies with Echo Reply. Round-trip time measured.
    

### OSPF behavior (short)

-   Router A and B exchange LSAs about their directly connected links.
    
-   Each builds topology map and computes shortest paths. If a link changes, routers flood updated LSAs and recompute quickly.

# 🌐 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

### 🔹 Purpose

Provides **reliable, connection-oriented communication** between two devices over IP. Used when accuracy and order of data delivery matter.

### 🔹 How it works (step-by-step)

1.  **Connection Establishment** – Uses a **3-way handshake**:
    
    -   Client sends `SYN` (synchronize).
        
    -   Server replies `SYN + ACK`.
        
    -   Client replies `ACK`.  
        ✅ Now the connection is established.
        
2.  **Data Transfer** –
    
    -   Data is broken into **segments**.
        
    -   Each segment has a **sequence number** so the receiver can reorder if they arrive out of sequence.
        
    -   Receiver sends **ACKs (acknowledgments)** back.
        
    -   If sender doesn’t get an ACK → it retransmits (reliability).
        
3.  **Flow Control** –
    
    -   Uses **window size** (sliding window) so sender doesn’t overwhelm receiver.
        
4.  **Congestion Control** –
    
    -   TCP slows down when network is congested (algorithms like Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit, Fast Recovery).
        
5.  **Connection Termination** – Uses a **4-step process** (`FIN` and `ACK` exchanges) to gracefully close the connection.
    

### 🔹 Features

-   Connection-oriented.
    
-   Reliable (ACK + retransmission).
    
-   Ensures ordered delivery.
    
-   Supports flow & congestion control.
    
-   Byte-stream oriented (continuous flow of data).
    

### 🔹 Advantages

-   Guarantees delivery (retransmission if lost).
    
-   Maintains order of packets.
    
-   Handles congestion automatically.
    
-   Suitable for applications where accuracy matters (e.g., file transfer, emails).
    

### 🔹 Disadvantages

-   Slower than UDP due to overhead (ACKs, retransmissions, congestion control).
    
-   More complex headers (20–60 bytes).
    
-   Not ideal for real-time applications.
    

### 🔹 Common Uses

-   Web browsing (**HTTP/HTTPS**).
    
-   File transfer (**FTP**).
    
-   Email (**SMTP, IMAP, POP3**).
    
-   Remote login (**SSH, Telnet**).

# 🌐 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

### 🔹 Purpose

Provides **fast, connectionless communication** between two devices. Used when speed is more important than reliability.

### 🔹 How it works (step-by-step)

1.  **No connection setup** – sender can just start sending packets.
    
2.  **Data Transfer** –
    
    -   Data is sent in **datagrams** (independent packets).
        
    -   Each datagram contains source & destination ports + checksum.
        
    -   No ACKs, no retransmission if lost.
        
3.  **No flow or congestion control** – sender keeps sending regardless of receiver capacity.
    

### 🔹 Features

-   Connectionless (no handshake).
    
-   Unreliable (no ACKs, no retransmission).
    
-   No ordering guarantee.
    
-   Lightweight, small header (8 bytes).
    
-   Message-oriented (datagrams).
    

### 🔹 Advantages

-   Very fast (no handshake, no overhead).
    
-   Low latency (good for real-time apps).
    
-   Efficient for broadcasting/multicasting.
    

### 🔹 Disadvantages

-   No guarantee of delivery.
    
-   Packets may arrive out of order.
    
-   No congestion or flow control (can cause packet loss in busy networks).
    
-   Less secure compared to TCP.
    

### 🔹 Common Uses

-   **Live video/audio streaming** (YouTube Live, Zoom, VoIP).
    
-   **Online gaming** (low-latency matters).

# 🌐 HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

-   **Layer**: Application Layer
    
-   **Port**: Default is **80**
    
-   **Purpose**: Foundation of web communication → used to transfer web pages, images, videos, etc. between a **client (browser)** and **server**.
    
-   **How it works**:
    
    1.  Client (browser) sends a request → "GET /index.html"
        
    2.  Server responds with the web page or data.
        
    3.  Uses **stateless protocol** → each request is independent, no memory of previous requests.
        
-   **Advantages**:
    
    -   Simple and widely supported.
        
    -   Fast (no encryption overhead).
        
-   **Disadvantages**:
    
    -   **Insecure** (data sent in plain text).
        
    -   Vulnerable to eavesdropping, tampering, man-in-the-middle attacks.
        

----------

# 🔒 HTTPS (HTTP Secure)

-   **Layer**: Application Layer (but uses **SSL/TLS** for security at Transport Layer)
    
-   **Port**: Default is **443**
    
-   **Purpose**: Secure version of HTTP → protects communication between browser and server.
    
-   **How it works**:
    
    1.  Starts like HTTP, but before data transfer → performs a **TLS handshake**.
        
    2.  Server shares a **digital certificate** (verified by Certificate Authority).
        
    3.  Secure **encryption key** is exchanged.
        
    4.  Then, HTTP messages are transmitted securely (encrypted).
        
-   **Advantages**:
    
    -   Confidentiality (data is encrypted).
        
    -   Integrity (data can’t be modified).
        
    -   Authentication (you know you’re talking to the real server).
        
    -   Essential for secure browsing, payments, banking, etc.
        
-   **Disadvantages**:
    
    -   Slightly slower (encryption/decryption overhead).
        
    -   Certificates cost money and need management.
        

----------

# 🖥️ SSH (Secure Shell)

-   **Layer**: Application Layer
    
-   **Port**: Default is **22**
    
-   **Purpose**: Securely access and manage remote systems (like Linux servers).
    
-   **How it works**:
    
    1.  Client initiates connection → server responds.
        
    2.  Authentication → via password or SSH keys (public/private key pair).
        
    3.  Encrypted session is created → now you can run commands remotely, transfer files (SCP/SFTP).
        
-   **Advantages**:
    
    -   Strong encryption → protects against eavesdropping.
        
    -   Allows remote login, file transfer, tunneling.
        
    -   Public key authentication is very secure.
        
-   **Disadvantages**:
    
    -   Needs careful key management (lost keys = trouble).
        
    -   If weak passwords are used → can be brute-forced.
        

----------

# ⏰ NTP (Network Time Protocol)

-   **Layer**: Application Layer (but works closely with transport + network layers)
    
-   **Port**: **123** (uses UDP mostly)
    
-   **Purpose**: Synchronize the clocks of computers and devices over a network.
    
-   **How it works**:
    
    1.  NTP client asks NTP server for the correct time.
        
    2.  Server replies with timestamp (based on atomic clocks / GPS).
        
    3.  Client adjusts its system clock → maintains synchronization.
        
    4.  Uses **stratum levels** (hierarchy of servers):
        
        -   Stratum 0 → high-precision sources (atomic/GPS clock).
            
        -   Stratum 1 → directly connected to stratum 0.
            
        -   Stratum 2+ → gets time from stratum 1.
            
-   **Advantages**:
    
    -   Keeps distributed systems in sync (critical for transactions, logging, security).
        
    -   Highly accurate (milliseconds to microseconds).
        
-   **Disadvantages**:
    
    -   Vulnerable to attacks (spoofed time servers → mislead systems).
        
    -   Needs proper configuration and trusted servers.

    \text{Propagation Delay} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Propagation Speed of medium}}  
    ]
    
-   **Factors**: Distance, type of medium (fiber, copper, wireless).
    

### 🔹 5. **Processing + Propagation + Queuing + Transmission = Total Delay**

-   Total end-to-end delay = sum of all delays in the network path.
    

### 🔹 Notes

-   **Propagation delay** dominates in long-distance networks (satellite, undersea).
    
-   **Queuing delay** dominates in congested networks.
    
-   **Transmission delay** dominates with large packets and slow links.

# **1️⃣ VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

### 🔹 Definition

-   A **VPN** is a technology that allows you to **securely connect to another network over the Internet**.
    
-   It creates a **private “tunnel”** so that your data is encrypted and safe from outsiders.
    
-   Essentially, it allows your device to appear as if it’s on a private network even when using a public network.
    

----------

### 🔹 How VPN Works

1.  **VPN Client** on your device initiates a connection to the **VPN Server**.
    
2.  They perform **authentication** (username/password or certificates).
    
3.  A **secure tunnel** is created using encryption protocols (SSL, TLS, or IPsec).
    
4.  All data is encrypted before leaving your device → travels through the Internet → decrypted at the VPN server.
    
5.  Your **IP address is masked** → websites see the VPN server’s IP instead of your real IP.
    

----------

### 🔹 VPN Protocols

| Protocol        | Description              | Security | Example Use              |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------ |
| **PPTP**        | Old protocol, fast       | Low      | Legacy VPNs              |
| **L2TP/IPsec**  | Tunneling + encryption   | High     | Remote work VPN          |
| **OpenVPN**     | Open-source, very secure | High     | Corporate & personal VPN |
| **IKEv2/IPsec** | Fast, stable on mobile   | High     | Mobile VPNs              |

----------

### 🔹 Types of VPNs

1.  **Remote Access VPN** – Connects individual users to a private network remotely.
    
2.  **Site-to-Site VPN** – Connects two networks (like two office branches) securely over the Internet.
    

----------

### 🔹 Advantages

-   **Security**: Data is encrypted → safe from hackers.
    
-   **Privacy**: Hides your IP → protects identity and browsing history.

# **2️⃣ Firewall**

### 🔹 Definition

-   A **firewall** is a **network security system** that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on a set of security rules.
    
-   Think of it as a **gatekeeper** that decides which data is allowed to enter or leave your network.
    

----------

### 🔹 How Firewall Works

1.  Monitors **network traffic** → packets coming in and going out.
    
2.  Compares traffic with **predefined rules** (allow, block, log).
    
3.  Blocks malicious traffic → allows safe traffic.
    
4.  Can also track **state of connections** (stateful firewalls).
    

----------

### 🔹 Types of Firewalls

| Type                                | Description                                                            | Example Use                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |

# **DNS (Domain Name System) – In Detail**

### 🔹 What is DNS?

-   DNS is a **hierarchical, distributed naming system** that translates **human-readable domain names** (like `www.example.com`) into **IP addresses** (like `192.168.1.1`) that computers use to locate each other on a network.
    
-   Without DNS, we’d have to remember IP addresses for every website.
    

----------

### 🔹 How DNS Works – Step by Step

1.  **User Types URL** – e.g., `www.google.com` in browser.
    
2.  **DNS Resolver (Recursive)** – The client asks its **recursive DNS server** for the IP.
    
3.  **Cache Check** – Resolver checks if it already has the IP in cache.
    
4.  **Root DNS Server** – If not cached, resolver queries one of the **13 root DNS servers**, which direct it to the **TLD server**.
    
5.  **TLD Server** – Points to the **authoritative DNS server** for the domain.
    
6.  **Authoritative DNS Server** – Returns the exact IP address of the domain.
    
7.  **Resolver Sends IP to Client** – Browser connects to the web server at that IP.
    

----------

### 🔹 Types of DNS Servers

| DNS Server Type         | Role / Function                                             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recursive DNS Resolver  | Receives query from client, recursively queries other DNS servers until IP is found |
| Root DNS Server         | Directs queries to the appropriate Top-Level Domain (TLD) server |
| TLD DNS Server          | Handles queries for a specific TLD (.com, .org, .net) and points to authoritative server |
| Authoritative DNS Server | Contains the actual mapping of domain names to IP addresses |
| Caching DNS Server      | Stores DNS query results temporarily to speed up future queries |

----------

### 🔹 Types of DNS Records
| Record Type | Purpose / Description                              | Example                        |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| A          | Maps domain to IPv4 address                        | example.com → 93.184.216.34   |
| AAAA       | Maps domain to IPv6 address                        | example.com → 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946 |
| CNAME      | Canonical name – creates an alias for another domain | www.example.com → example.com  |
| MX         | Mail Exchange – defines email servers for domain  | example.com → mail.example.com |
| NS         | Name Server – specifies authoritative DNS servers | example.com → ns1.example.com |
| TXT        | Text data for verification, SPF, DKIM, etc.       | v=spf1 include:_spf.example.com ~all |
| PTR        | Reverse mapping – IP to domain name               | 34.216.184.93 → example.com    |
| SRV        | Service locator – specifies ports for services    | _sip._tcp.example.com → 5060   |

----------

### 🔹 Types of DNS Queries

| Query Type       | Description                                   |

# **Private vs Public IP Address**

### 🔹 **1. Private IP Address**

-   Used **within a private network** (LAN).
    
-   Not routable on the Internet.
    
-   Devices use private IPs to communicate **internally**.
    
-   Must be translated to a **public IP** via NAT (Network Address Translation) to access the Internet.
    

**Common Private IP Ranges (per RFC 1918)**:

| Class | Range               |
|-------|-------------------|
| A     | 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 |
| B     | 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 |
| C     | 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 |


----------

### 🔹 **2. Public IP Address**

-   Assigned by **ISP** and used on the **Internet**.
    
-   Globally unique; can be accessed from anywhere on the Internet.
    
-   Used to identify networks or devices outside the local network.
    

----------

### 🔹 Key Differences

| Feature                | Private IP Address                     | Public IP Address                       |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Scope                  | Internal network (LAN)                | Global Internet                         |
| Accessibility          | Not accessible from the Internet      | Accessible from anywhere on the Internet |
| Uniqueness             | Can be reused in multiple networks    | Must be unique worldwide                |
| Assigned By            | Network administrator                 | Internet Service Provider (ISP)         |
| Cost                   | Free                                   | Usually provided by ISP (may cost)     |
| Example                | 192.168.1.10, 10.0.0.5                | 142.250.190.78, 172.217.16.14          |
| Security               | Safer from direct Internet attacks    | Exposed to Internet attacks; needs firewall/NAT |
| Translation Required   | Yes, needs NAT to communicate externally | No translation needed                   |


----------

### 🔹 Notes

-   Most **home routers** assign **private IPs** to devices and use **one public IP** for Internet access.
    
-   NAT (Network Address Translation) bridges private and public IPs.
    

----------
# **TCP 3-Way Handshake**

### 🔹 Definition

-   The **TCP 3-way handshake** is the **process used to establish a reliable connection** between a client and server before data transfer.
    
-   TCP is a **connection-oriented protocol**, so it needs to ensure both sides are ready to communicate.
    

----------

### 🔹 Purpose

1.  **Synchronize sequence numbers** between client and server.
    
2.  **Establish a reliable connection** before transmitting data.
    
3.  Ensure both client and server are ready to send and receive packets.
    

----------

### 🔹 Steps of 3-Way Handshake

TCP uses **three steps**: **SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK**

| Step | Sender   | Flags       | Sequence / Acknowledgment Details                       | Description                                                      |
|------|---------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Client  | SYN        | Seq = x, Ack = 0                                       | Client sends SYN (synchronize) to server to initiate connection |
| 2    | Server  | SYN + ACK  | Seq = y, Ack = x+1                                     | Server responds with SYN-ACK, acknowledging client’s SYN        |
| 3    | Client  | ACK        | Seq = x+1, Ack = y+1                                   | Client sends ACK to acknowledge server’s SYN, connection established |


-   **SYN**: Synchronize sequence numbers
    
-   **ACK**: Acknowledge received packets
    
-   **Seq (Sequence Number)**: Indicates the first byte in the segment
    
-   **Ack (Acknowledgment Number)**: Indicates the next expected byte
    

----------

### 🔹 How It Works (Detailed Explanation)

1.  **Step 1 – SYN (Client → Server)**
    
    -   Client wants to open a connection.
        
    -   Sends a TCP segment with **SYN flag set** and a **sequence number x**.
        
    -   No data is sent yet.
        
2.  **Step 2 – SYN-ACK (Server → Client)**
    
    -   Server receives the SYN.
        
    -   Allocates resources for connection.
        
    -   Sends **SYN-ACK segment**:
        
        -   SYN: Server’s own sequence number y
            
        -   ACK: Acknowledges client’s SYN by setting Ack = x + 1
            
3.  **Step 3 – ACK (Client → Server)**
    
    -   Client receives SYN-ACK.
        
    -   Sends final **ACK**: Ack = y + 1
        
    -   Connection is now **established**.
        

----------

### 🔹 Example (Sequence Numbers)

| Packet | From    | To      | Flags   | Seq  | Ack  |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|------|------|
| 1      | Client | Server | SYN    | 1000 | 0    |
| 2      | Server | Client | SYN-ACK| 5000 | 1001 |
| 3      | Client | Server | ACK    | 1001 | 5001 |


-   After this handshake, both client and server **know each other’s sequence numbers**.
    
-   **Data transfer can start reliably**.

# **What Happens When You Type a URL in Browser**

Suppose you type `https://www.example.com` in your browser. Several things happen **behind the scenes**:

----------

## **1️⃣ URL Parsing**

-   Browser breaks the URL into parts:
    

| Part       | Example Value         | Purpose                              |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Protocol   | https               | Determines the communication protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) |
| Domain     | www.example.com     | Specifies the website address        |
| Port       | 443 (default for HTTPS) | Network port to connect to the server |
| Path       | /index.html         | Specific page or resource on server  |
| Query      | ?id=123             | Optional data sent to server         |


----------

## **2️⃣ DNS Resolution**

-   Browser needs **IP address** of the domain to connect.
    
-   Steps:
    
| Step                | Action                                                      |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Browser Cache       | Checks if IP is cached locally                              |
| OS / Resolver Cache | Checks OS cache or DNS resolver                             |
| Recursive DNS Query | Queries DNS servers (Root → TLD → Authoritative)           |
| IP Received         | Browser gets IP of www.example.com, e.g., 93.184.216.34   |


----------

## **3️⃣ TCP Connection (3-Way Handshake)**

-   Browser establishes **TCP connection** with server’s IP on port 443 (HTTPS).
    
-   Steps:
    
| Step | Client → Server           | Server → Client            | Purpose                                     |
|------|--------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1    | SYN                      |                           | Client requests connection                  |
| 2    |                          | SYN-ACK                   | Server acknowledges request                |

----------

## **4️⃣ TLS/SSL Handshake (If HTTPS)**

-   For **secure HTTPS connection**, browser and server perform SSL/TLS handshake:
    

| Step | Action                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Browser sends “Client Hello” with supported encryption algorithms       |
| 2    | Server responds with “Server Hello” and its SSL certificate            |
| 3    | Browser verifies server certificate (CA)                               |
| 4    | Browser and server exchange session keys (encrypted)                   |
| 5    | Secure encrypted channel established                                   |


----------

## **5️⃣ HTTP Request**

-   Browser sends **HTTP request** to server to get the page:
    

| Request Component  | Description                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Method           | GET / POST / PUT, etc. (e.g., GET /index.html)           |
| Headers          | Metadata about request (User-Agent, Cookies, etc.)       |
| Body             | Optional data sent to server (for POST, PUT requests)   |


----------

## **6️⃣ Server Processing**

-   Server receives request and processes it:
    

| Action                  | Description                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Routing                 | Server determines which file or script to execute       |
| Backend Processing      | Executes code (PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.)             |
| Database Queries        | Fetches data if needed                                   |
| Response Generation     | Server creates HTTP response with status code, headers, and body |


----------

## **7️⃣ HTTP Response**

-   Server sends **HTTP response** to browser:
    

| Response Component | Description                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Status Code       | 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error        |
| Headers           | Metadata (Content-Type, Cookies, Cache-Control)         |
| Body              | HTML content, JSON, images, or other resources         |


----------

## **8️⃣ Browser Rendering**

-   Browser receives the response and renders the page:
    
| Step                      | Action                                             |

| Execute Additional Scripts| Dynamic updates via JS, AJAX, or WebSockets      |


----------

## **9️⃣ Optional Caching**

-   Browser may **store static resources** (images, CSS, JS) locally for faster access next time.
    

----------

## **Summary Flow**

1. URL typed → Browser parses URL
2. DNS lookup → Gets server IP
3. TCP handshake → Connection established
4. TLS/SSL handshake → Secure channel created (HTTPS)
5. HTTP request → Browser asks server for content
6. Server processes request → Generates response
7. HTTP response → Browser receives page
8. Browser renders → Displays page
9. Caching → Stores resources for future visits

# **Ports in Networking**

### 🔹 What are Ports?

-   **Ports** are logical numbers used by the **Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)** to identify **specific processes or services** on a device.
    
-   They allow multiple applications to use the **same IP address** simultaneously without conflicts.
    
-   Think of a port as a **door** on your computer for network traffic:
    
    -   IP = House address
        
    -   Port = Door to the specific room (application/service)
        

----------

### 🔹 Where are Ports?

-   **Ports exist at the Transport Layer** (TCP & UDP).
    
-   TCP/UDP headers contain a **source port** and a **destination port** number.
    
-   Combined with IP, it forms a **socket**:
    

```
Socket = IP Address + Port Number
Example: 192.168.1.2:80

```

----------

### 🔹 Port Number Ranges

| Port Range            | Type / Use                              | Range        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------|
| Well-Known Ports      | Reserved for common services           | 0 – 1023     |
| Registered Ports      | Assigned to specific applications      | 1024 – 49151 |
| Dynamic / Private     | Temporary ports for client connections | 49152 – 65535|


----------

----------

### 🔹 Key Points

-   **TCP vs UDP Ports**: Some services use TCP, some use UDP, and a few can use both.
    
-   **Security**: Open ports can be targets for attacks; firewalls can control access to ports.
    
-   **Dynamic/Private Ports**: Used temporarily by clients when connecting to servers.
    

----------

# **1️⃣ CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) Overview**

-   CSMA is a **network protocol** that helps devices **share a common communication medium** without interfering with each other.
    
-   Devices **listen before transmitting** to reduce collisions.
    
-   There are two main types: **CSMA/CD** (Collision Detection) and **CSMA/CA** (Collision Avoidance).
    

----------

# **2️⃣ CSMA/CD (Collision Detection)**

### 🔹 Definition

-   CSMA/CD is used in **wired networks** (like Ethernet).
    
-   It **detects collisions** on the network and takes action to resolve them.
    

----------

### 🔹 How CSMA/CD Works

1.  Device **listens** to the medium.
    
2.  If medium is **idle**, device transmits data.
    
3.  If **collision occurs**, devices **stop transmitting** immediately.
    
4.  Devices **wait for a random backoff time** before retrying.
    

----------

### 🔹 Table Summary

| Feature           | CSMA/CD                                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Medium Type       | Wired (Ethernet)                           |
| Collision Handling| Detects collisions and retries            |
| Mechanism         | Listen → Transmit → Detect → Backoff      |
| Efficiency        | High at low traffic; decreases with congestion |
| Example           | Traditional Ethernet (10BASE-T, 100BASE-T)|


----------

### 🔹 Advantages of CSMA/CD

| Advantage                        | Description                                     |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Simple protocol                   | Easy to implement in Ethernet networks         |
| Reduces repeated collisions       | Stops transmission immediately upon collision  |
| Works well in small networks      | Efficient when traffic is low                  |

# **3️⃣ CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)**

### 🔹 Definition

-   CSMA/CA is used in **wireless networks** (like Wi-Fi).
    
-   Unlike CSMA/CD, **collisions are avoided rather than detected** because wireless devices cannot always detect collisions.
    

----------

### 🔹 How CSMA/CA Works

1.  Device **listens** to the channel.
    
2.  If medium is **idle**, device waits a random backoff time before transmitting.
    
3.  Device may use **RTS/CTS (Request to Send / Clear to Send)** to **reserve the channel**.
    
4.  Data is transmitted **after channel is confirmed free**.

# **Error Control Mechanism**

### 🔹 Definition

-   **Error Control** is a process used in **data communication** to detect and correct errors that occur during transmission.
    
-   Errors can occur due to **noise, interference, signal attenuation, or packet loss**.
    
-   Error control ensures **reliable data transfer** between sender and receiver.
    

----------

### 🔹 Types of Errors in Transmission

| Error Type            | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Single-bit Error      | Only 1 bit in the data is corrupted             |
| Burst Error           | Multiple consecutive bits are corrupted         |
| Packet Loss           | Entire packet is lost in transmission           |
| Duplicate Packets     | Same packet received multiple times             |


----------

### 🔹 Error Detection Methods

| Method                 | How it Works                                           | Advantages                        | Disadvantages                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Parity Check           | Adds 1 extra bit (even/odd) to detect single-bit errors | Simple, low overhead               | Cannot detect burst errors         |
| Checksum               | Adds sum of all data bytes in header                  | Simple, works for packet-level errors | Limited error detection strength  |
| Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) | Polynomial-based calculation for error detection | Very reliable, detects burst errors | Slightly higher computation        |


----------

### 🔹 Error Control Techniques

Error control ensures **errors are corrected**, using **two main approaches**:

#### 1️⃣ **Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)**

-   **Receiver detects error** and asks sender to **retransmit** the packet.
    
-   Requires **acknowledgment (ACK)** from receiver.
    

| ARQ Type              | How it Works                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Stop-and-Wait ARQ     | Sender sends 1 packet → waits for ACK → sends next |
| Go-Back-N ARQ         | Sender can send multiple packets → retransmit from error packet |
| Selective Repeat ARQ  | Only erroneous packets are retransmitted         |


**Advantages:**

-   Ensures **data reliability**
    
-   Can handle **various types of errors**
    

**Disadvantages:**

-   Retransmission increases **delay**
    
-   Requires **buffering** at sender/receiver
    

----------

#### 2️⃣ **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**

-   **Sender adds redundant bits** to allow **receiver to correct errors without retransmission**.
    
-   Example: Hamming code, Reed-Solomon code.
    

**Advantages:**

-   No retransmission needed → faster in high-latency networks
    
-   Works in **real-time systems** (video, audio streaming)
    

**Disadvantages:**

-   Adds **extra bits**, increasing bandwidth usage
    
-   Complexity in encoding/decoding
    

----------

### 🔹 Comparison: ARQ vs FEC

| Feature              | ARQ (Retransmission)          | FEC (Forward Error Correction)        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Method              | Retransmit erroneous packets  | Correct errors using redundant bits  |
| Overhead            | Less redundant data           | Extra redundant bits                  |
| Latency             | Higher due to retransmission  | Lower, no retransmission needed      |
| Use Case            | Reliable file transfer        | Streaming, real-time communication   |
| Complexity          | Simple                        | More complex                          |


----------

### 🔹 Error Control Flow

```markdown
Sender → Adds parity/checksum/CRC → Sends data → Receiver checks for error → 
    If error detected: ARQ → request retransmission / FEC → correct data → deliver to application

```
